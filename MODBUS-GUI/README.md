# MODBUS-GUI

This MODBUS GUI was designed using wxpython library for live-time information display from machine/technologies. Tested by REON Technology, It was connected to a Mobile Power Station (MPS) using serial ports and requests could be sent to the machine in exchange of information about the MPS (battery, manufacture dates, etc.). I improved on the previous GUI designed by my employer to match the goal of REON, and I tested with another teammate to make sure the GUI is fully compatible with the MPS.
